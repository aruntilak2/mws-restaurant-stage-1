#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** This projec is about converting a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application and to make it work offline by working with Service worker and cache storge. 

### Technologies I used

Google provided the raw code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. Itâ€™s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device.So the first thing I did was used Bootstrap. 

### What did I use for local server?

Instead of using `http://localhost:8000` as instructed ( as my local machine was showing few errors), I changed the prot in dhhelper that is already configured to my code editor. So My local server worked will with that port

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:
I created Mapbox account with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). and I got Token and replaced `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>`.

##Thank you
I should thank Udacity , my mentors and students who helped me to finsh this project.
